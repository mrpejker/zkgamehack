# ZkNoid

ZkNoid store is a repository for the easiest way for building provable games on [Mina protocol](https://minaprotocol.com/).

ðŸš€ Founded on hackathon with the idea to provide infrastructure for #ZkDevs and unify the provable gaming ecosystem!

ZkNoid store is a home for provable games. Modular framework is provided for developers bringing all the infrastructure they need to easily deploy games on Mina Protocol. After Zk Proofs integration to the game process, game is listed on the store becoming a part of the project ecosystem

### Implementing your own game
ZkNoid is a modular platform that makes it easy to implement you own game using platform infrastructure. 
To build a game you need to create a game folder inside [packages/games](https://github.com/ZkNoid/store/tree/main/packages/games).
Define game config and implement front-end and contracts part in [packages/chain/src/games](https://github.com/ZkNoid/store/blob/main/packages/chain/src/games)
